# My Projects

A repository where all my Data Science, Web Development and Native Application Development projects and reports are stored along with the code for each report. Below is a short description of what each report contains:

## Data Science Projects
1. [Analysis of Countries using Multivariate Methods](https://github.com/obasagbenga10/My-Projects/blob/main/Analysis_Of_Countries_using_MultivariateMethods.pdf) : In this report, I analyze data (obtained from gapminder.com) of different countries with the aid of Multivariate Methods like Canonical Correlation, Principal Component Analysis and Discriminant Analysis. The visualisations in the report where generated with R Programming language.
2. [2019 NHS Dental Statistics](https://github.com/obasagbenga10/My-Projects/blob/main/ANALYSIS_OF_NHS_DENTAL_STATISTICS.pdf): NHS Dental Data from 2018-2019 is analyzed with the aid of visualizations from Tableau.
3. [The Global Distribution of COVID 19 Vaccines](https://github.com/obasagbenga10/My-Projects/blob/main/Covid_vaccination_analysis.pdf): A data analysis project that delves into COVID 19 Vaccination data of countries around the world. The report was carried out with the aid of python. The data was obtained from Kaggle.
4. [The Effect of Life Expectancy and Infant Mortality on the GDP of nations](https://github.com/obasagbenga10/My-Projects/blob/main/life_expectancy_infant_mortality_gdp.pdf)life_expectancy_infant_mortality_gdp.pdf: A report that goes into the effect life expectancy and infant mortality has on the GDP of countries around the world. A linear regression model was used to the determine the relationship between the variables. The analysis and visualisations were created with R programming language.
5. [The Disparity in the Age at First Kill of Serial Killers Across Multiple Motives](https://github.com/obasagbenga10/My-Projects/blob/main/SerialKiller_Analysis.pdf): A statistical report that goes into the ages of serial killers when they commit their first kill and the motives for their first kill. Hypothesis test were carried out to obtain inferences on the relationship.
